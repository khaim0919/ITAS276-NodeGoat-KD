## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability go to [](). This will allow you to submit a PRIVATE security vulnerability. If you believe any issue you may find has a security risk, do not submit an issue and instead submit a security vulnerability.

If a security vulnerability is found, and unused by the submittee, the submittee will face no legal concequence. For those who do not exploit these issues found there is a reward depending on the severity of the security vulnerability.
